# Deep-Learning
ðŸ”¹ 1. Bitcoin Prediction Using LSTM
This notebook builds a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict Bitcoin prices.

Key components:

Preprocessing Bitcoin price data with MinMaxScaler

Defining and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras

Evaluating prediction accuracy with mean_squared_error

Visualizing predicted vs. actual prices

This project demonstrates deep learning-based financial forecasting using recurrent neural networks.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Calculating Cosine Similarity Using Word2Vec
Implements Word2Vec embeddings to calculate cosine similarity between text inputs. The notebook includes:

Installing and using nltk and gensim libraries

Tokenizing and cleaning text

Generating word vectors using Word2Vec

Computing cosine similarity between word vectors

This project is useful for NLP tasks like semantic similarity, recommendation systems, or clustering text data.
